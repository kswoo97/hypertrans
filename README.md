# Official code and datasets of How Transitive Are Real-World Group Interactions? - Measurement and Reproduction

## Description

- This is an official code and datasets for How Transitive Are Real-World Group Interactions? - Measurement and Reproduction.
- FastHyperTrans and THera are implemented with JAVA
- Experimental results (Tables, Figures) are implemented with Python

## Dataset

We used 12 real-world hypergraph datasets. Details and source of each datasets are as follows.
1. Email (Enron, EU) [1]
2. NDC (Substances, Classes) [1]
3. Contact (High, Primary) [1]
4. Co-Authorship (DBLP, MAG-Geology, -History) [1]
5. Q&A (Ubuntu, Server, Math) [1, 2]

Since file sizes are more than 25MB, we uploaded datasets in the following URL:
